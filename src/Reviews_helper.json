      "review": "Raj of Designs by Raj, has an amazing sense of style and is incredibly talented. Her attention to detail is remarkable. Raj has the ability to turn the simplest objects  into extravagant show pieces. She takes the time to understand your style and figures out what you like even when you are unsure. She is professional , punctual, direct and absolutely delightful to work with. She tolerated my indecisiveness with such patience. I will admit that I can be difficult to work with but she was there to calm me down during my times of panic. After my very frugal husband saw her portfolio, he figured that she would be way above our designing budget. But Raj is able to work with all price points and managed to make my rooms look classy and luxurious. Can't say enough great things.",

She also has amazing taste and finds the perfect pieces. She utilized some of my existing pieces instead of making me start from scratch. I height recommend DBR!!",
